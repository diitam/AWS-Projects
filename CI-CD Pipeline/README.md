Steps for AWS Deployment Pipeline Setup
Create a Deployment Target

Set up an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to host your application.
Elastic Beanstalk handles server management and scaling, providing a reliable and automated foundation for running your code.
Build the Deployment Pipeline

Use AWS Code Pipeline to create a seamless workflow.
Connect your source code repository (e.g., GitHub) to the pipeline.
Configure the pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
Test the Pipeline

Make changes to your source code to test the pipeline's functionality.
Observe as the pipeline triggers automatic updates, validating the automation process.
