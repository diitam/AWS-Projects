Steps for AWS Deployment
1. Network – Amazon VPC
Create a VPC: Lay the foundation by establishing a Virtual Private Cloud to ensure secure networking.
Configure Subnets: Define public subnets for accessible resources and private subnets for internal communication.
Set Up Networking Resources:
Add endpoints for private connections.
Configure DNS settings for name resolution.
Use gateways (Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway) for routing.
2. Compute – Amazon EC2
Launch EC2 Instances: Deploy virtual servers to host applications.
Security Groups: Set up inbound and outbound rules to control traffic.
User Data Scripts: Automate instance initialization with startup scripts.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distribute incoming traffic to maintain availability and balance load.
Auto-scaling Group: Dynamically scale instances based on demand for optimal performance and cost efficiency.
3. Database – Amazon Aurora
Database Cluster Setup: Deploy a high-performance Aurora database for your application.
Connectivity: Ensure secure access using VPC security groups.
Data Security:
Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
Implement automated backups and multi-AZ deployment.
Secrets Manager: Securely manage credentials using AWS Secrets Manager.
4. Clean Up Resources
Terminate unused instances, databases, and load balancers.
Delete subnets, VPCs, and other networking components.
Remove credentials and secrets stored in Secrets Manager.
Verify all resources are terminated to avoid unnecessary costs.
