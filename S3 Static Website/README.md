1. Log in to AWS Console
Access the AWS console.
Search for S3 in the top search bar and select it.
2. Create an S3 Bucket
Click on Create bucket.
Enter a unique Bucket name for your website.
3. Adjust Bucket Settings
Uncheck Block all public access to make your website publicly accessible.
Click Create bucket.
4. Select Your Bucket

5. Enable Static Website Hosting
Go to the Properties tab.
Scroll to Static website hosting and click Edit.
Enable hosting and specify your website's index document (e.g., index.html).
6. Add Optional Error Handling
Optionally, specify an error document (e.g., error.html) to display when a file is not found.
Save the changes.
7. Get Your Website Endpoint
Enabling Static website hosting generates a unique bucket endpoint URL for your site.

Allow public access to your website files.
Under the Permissions tab, locate the Bucket policy section.

}
9. Upload Website Files
