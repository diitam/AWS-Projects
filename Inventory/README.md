Implementation Steps
1. Create an S3 Bucket
Store CSV files containing inventory data.
Ensure appropriate permissions for Lambda access.
2. Set Up DynamoDB
Create a table for storing inventory records.
Define attributes like store, product, and count.
3. Configure an SNS Topic
Establish a notification system to alert about low inventory.
Subscribe relevant endpoints (email, SMS, or HTTP).
4. Create IAM Roles for Lambda
Grant permissions to Lambda functions for:
Reading data from S3.
Updating DynamoDB records.
Publishing messages to SNS.
5. Develop Lambda Functions
File Processing Function: Reads the CSV file from S3.
Inventory Update Function: Updates inventory counts in DynamoDB.
Notification Function: Sends alerts for items with low inventory.
